CodexAnimalCommEngine
======================

Project: Codex-Animal Communication Engine (CACE)
Date: 2025-06-27

Overview:
This engine reverse-engineers the communicational signatures of elephants, hawks, cobras, and orcas. It uses acoustic models, symbolic mathematics, and Codex Theorems to transduce and tag cross-species communication for decoding and synthetic application.

Subsystems:
1. Input Capture
   - Audio: Ultrasonic (hawks), Infrasound (elephants), Pulsed sonar (orcas)
   - Visual: Dorsal/flank positioning, threat displays
   - Vibration/Seismic: Elephant ground wave detectors

2. Signal Classification
   - Frequency bandpass filters
   - Neural dialect models (based on Orca dialect research)
   - Temporal tagging system for phrase detection

3. Codex Integration
   - Theorem #8: Harmonic Recovery Loop – Elephant name detection
   - Theorem #9: Elemental Equilibrium – Orca signal normalization
   - Theorem #10: Paradox Loop – Cobra threat mitigation logic

4. Translator Layer
   - Converts frequency/time/dialect sequences into symbolic glyph patterns
   - Maps output to UI tags readable by SMP v1.0 UI

Use Cases:
- Wildlife Conservation & Monitoring
- Sovereign AI Wildlife Interfaces
- Ritual bioacoustics & spiritual eco-calibration
