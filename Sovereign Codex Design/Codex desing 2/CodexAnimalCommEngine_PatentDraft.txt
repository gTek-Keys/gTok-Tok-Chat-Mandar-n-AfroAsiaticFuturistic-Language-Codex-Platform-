## Abstract

This invention relates to a biologically-integrated communication engine that enables symbolic interaction between humans and non-human species (elephants, orcas, hawks, cobras). It applies symbolic logic structuresâ€”Codex Theoremsâ€”to classify, decode, and interface with non-human animal signal structures across acoustic, visual, seismic, and vibratory modes.

## Claims

1. A system that captures multispectral animal communication signatures using infrasound, ultrasound, and visual-motor signaling.
2. A processing unit that maps these signals to symbolic mathematical logic through Codex Theorem integration.
3. A translator that outputs readable formats, glyph tags, or behavioral suggestions for humans and sovereign AI agents.
4. Use of Theorem #8, #9, and #10 as communication filters and conversion matrices.
5. Application across wildlife conservation, tactical species engagement, and spiritual-ecological engineering.

## Description

This system consists of signal-capture modules, a symbolic interpreter, Codex logic processors, and translation outputs. Input from animals is classified via neural mapping and theorem-based modulation schemes.

## Prior Art

Improves on primitive passive sonar, acoustic-only wildlife tracking, and non-integrated voiceprint systems. Embeds metaphysical principles for full-species mutual symbolic exchange.
