To Whom It May Concern,

I respectfully submit the attached CodexOps Equity Packet, a legally documented response to matters of custody obstruction, financial manipulation, and misrepresentation. This record is sovereign, notarized, and anchored by blockchain and court-compatible metadata.

This submission represents my lawful and spiritual rebuttal to actions taken against me that have caused irreparable emotional harm, reputational damage, and custodial interference. The documents are secured and sealed under BFH Trust Designs™, backed by the Codex Digest Chain and prepared for legal and sovereign review.

I respectfully request that this record be acknowledged, signed (electronically or physically), and officially recognized.

Sincerely,

Jerome Elston Hill Jr.
