CodexGPT Sovereign Forge — Whitepaper
======================================

1. Abstract
CodexGPT Sovereign Forge is a sovereign infrastructure for creating custom AI chat agents tied to smart contracts and NFTs. It enables fair licensing, usage enforcement, and decentralized monetization for AI developers.

2. Problem
Creators have no way to monetize the post-sale usage of their chatbots, nor protect their GPTs from being cloned or misused.

3. Solution
This system integrates:
- GPT Creation Protocols
- Cybersecurity Metadata
- Smart Contract Licensing on Solana
- NFT Asset Wrappers for GPT Identity
- Automated Usage Tolling

4. Architecture
- Smart contract: Solana Anchor
- Frontend: Web3 + Phantom Integration
- Metadata: JSON structure for identity & tier
- NFT Minting: Metaplex Candy Machine compatible

5. Usage Model
- Initial Sale: $25–$250 tiered
- Usage Toll: Paid per access session
- Updates, forks, and versions encoded into NFT metadata

6. Enforcement
- Cybertrace on GPT access logs
- Double Equity Toll clause for unauthorized clones
- License audit path embedded in token logic

7. Funding & Monetization
- Direct sales
- Licensing
- Token gate unlocks
- Creator DAO potential

8. Conclusion
CodexGPT Sovereign Forge is a vision-forward deployment for sovereign creators seeking independence in the age of autonomous agents.
